A Random Password Generator

Generates 2 random passwords from 8 to 18 total characters (user's choice) on button press. 
The passwords include all possible characters (like "/", "!", "#" etc etc).
Also added a function to copy the generated passwords to clipboard 
whenever the user clicks them and alert him it did so.

This is a small personal project I made to practice muscle memory

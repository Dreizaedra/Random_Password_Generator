A Random Password Generator

Generates 2 random passwords from 8 to 18 total characters (user's choice) on button press. 
The passwords include all possible characters (like "/", "!", "#" etc etc).
Also added a function to copy the generated passwords to clipboard 
whenever the user clicks them and alert him it did so. 

Please look at 'Example.png' located in the images folder 
if you want to see what this tool looks like.

This is a small personal project I made to practice muscle memory, mostly coding JS 
and experimenting a bit with flexbox settings in CSS more than anything else.

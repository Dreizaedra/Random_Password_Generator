A Random Password Generator

Generates 2 random passwords from 8 to 18 characters (user's choice) on button press. 
It includes all possible characters (like "/", "!", "#" etc etc).
I also added a function to copy the generated passwords to clipboard
and alert the user it did so whenever he clicks them. 

This is a personal project I made to practice coding more than anything else.
